## How to implement a task and/or a technique

An instance of a Task is the place where the technique runs. An instance of a technique is where the information of 
each `ResourceEntry` is processed, generating a result that will be stored on the `ResourceEntry` itself.  

For more information, please check the [glossary](./glossary.md).

### Implement a new Task

1. Give your task a name (this name will be used in the configuration file).
2. Create a class that extends `Task` and save it at `"./src/tasks"`.
3. Implement the abstract methods: 
    1. `Task.run()` that returns a list with the results generated by the task for every resource entry that the 
       technique were applied.
    2. `Task.get_fields_for_technique()` that returns a list fields that are mandatory to execute the task.
4. Adjust method `Utils.__build_task()` to return the correct class according to the task name.    

### Implement a new Technique

1. Give your technique a name (this name will be used in the configuration file).
2. Create a class that extends `Technique` and save it at `"./src/tasks"`.
3. Implement the abstract methods:
    1. `Technique.run()` that returns a list with the results generated by the technique for every resource entry 
       that the technique were applied.
4. Adjust method `Utils.build_technique()` to return the correct class according to the technique name.
